UW Coding Bootcamp Homework Assignment 1

In this assignment, I'm learning about how important HTML Semantics are for the Accessibility of reading webpages.

I'm referencing [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) article on accessibility in HTML, understanding it's importance and how it works. I found this webpage when I was originally searching for ideas on the tags to make background photos more accessible on the webpage

I also referenced this [site](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56803764/what-is-the-main-tag-in-html5-how-does-it-differ-from-body-tag/56806665) in trying to understand the difference between `main` and `body` tags in html.
